String aboutMe =
    'I taught high school math and computer science for 12 years before taking an opportunity to work with a FinTech startup company, FloatMe, as their Head of UX, designing and developing their app from start to release. After its release I wanted to grow my design and development skills as quickly as possible and co-founded a software developement company, Cleartech Software, giving me the opportunity to work on numerous different projects. Since the summer of 2021 I have had the opportunity to work with the mobile development team at Amica Mutal Insurance as they migrate their mobile app from React Native to Flutter.';
